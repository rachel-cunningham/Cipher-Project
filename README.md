# Cipher-Project, within this project I wrote a function in javascript and a test case using mocha and chai to create a useable Caesar, polybius square, and substitution cipher. In this project I focused on using helper functions to write cleaner code as well as including code that will catch edge cases. For this project, I learned how to use 2-d arrays in order to avoid manually creating a encoding/decoding dictionary for the polybius square cipher.
